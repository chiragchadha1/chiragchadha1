Hi there! I'm Chirag, a software engineer passionate about entrepreneurship, driving impactful innovation, and creating exceptional user experiences.

At [HubSpot](https://hubspot.com), I led engineering enhancements in user interfaces and backend services using Python, Java, and TypeScript, significantly boosting system functionality and user engagement. I fostered a collaborative team environment by mentoring and conducting technical workshops on efficient front-end debugging.

Beyond my technical roles, I've undertaken diverse leadership positions that have honed my creative problem-solving abilities:

- 👔 CEO/Founder of [defye](https://defye.us), a digital design agency where I lead strategic operations and innovative client solutions.
- 🚀 Project Lead for Couplet, pioneering a groundbreaking mobile app that redefines social networking through shared interests in local events.
- 🎨 Content Lead at Generate, driving a successful rebranding campaign and digital strategy, garnering over 103,773 impressions.
- 💻 Front-End Developer at [VUE Health](https://vuehealth.com), crafting responsive websites for top healthcare brands, championing accessibility and user-centered design.
- 🤩 Co-Director of Engage at the [Entrepreneurs Club]([url](https://www.nuentrepreneursclub.com/)), designing and delivering high-impact entrepreneurship workshops and securing high-profile speakers.

I thrive on tackling complex challenges, blending technical expertise with creative problem-solving to deliver exceptional results. My passion lies in leveraging technology to create engaging experiences and drive meaningful impact.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I’m interested in aesthetic designs, sneakers, electronic dance music (EDM), photography, mindfulness, self-care, science-fiction movies, travel, and weightlifting.
